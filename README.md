# Factorio Planner

Factorio Planner helps you plan your factories by computing how many
resources and machines you need to produce a given throughput of
resources. Try it here: http://doomeer.com/factorio

## Current Version

Recipes for Factorio version 0.17.

## Architecture

Factorio Planner is written in OCaml, but is then compiled to Javascript
using js_of_ocaml.

* `index.html` is the HTML page which loads the Javascript.
* `factorio.js` is the Javascript compiled from the OCaml code.
  It is included in the repository in case you don't want to compile it.
* `factoriojs.ml` is the main file, which implements the Web interface.
* `factorio.ml` contains type definitions and the code to compute
  ressource summaries.
* `recipes.ml` contains maker and ressource definitions.
  This is the file you want to modify to change ingredients or add
  new ressources.
* `html.mli` is the interface to `html.ml`, which provides helpers
  for Web interfaces.
